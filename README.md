### Introduction 1

User interface and user experience (UI/UX) designer is one of the most popular job titles in the technology industry. UI/UX designers tend to enjoy the challenges associated with creating products that people love.

Having foundational principles of design and design techniques, such as design thinking, gives you a mindset required to create an effective user experience. You are also able to conduct user research that gives you a better understanding of the problem space and eventually leads you to communicate your designs and best practices to users through prototyping.
